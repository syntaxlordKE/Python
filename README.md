# Python List Operations

This program demonstrates basic **list operations** in Python, including `append`, `insert`, `extend`, `pop`, `sort`, and `index`.  
It builds a list step by step and shows the results after each operation.

## 📌 Features
The program performs the following steps:

1. **Create an empty list** called `my_list`.
2. **Append** the elements `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at the second position (index `1`).
4. **Extend** the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element from the list using `pop()`.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find and print** the index of the value `30`.
