# Week 2 Assignment - Python List Operations

This program demonstrates basic **list operations** in Python, including `append`, `insert`, `extend`, `pop`, `sort`, and `index`.

It builds a list step by step and shows the results after each operation.

## üìå Features

The program performs the following steps:

1. **Create an empty list** called `my_list`.
2. **Append** the elements `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at the second position (index `1`).
4. **Extend** the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element from the list using `pop()`.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find and print** the index of the value `30`.

# Week 3 Assignment - Control Flows and Functions in Python

This program demonstrates the use of **control flows** (`if`, `else`, `try-except`) and **functions** in Python.  
It calculates the final price of an item based on the discount percentage provided by the user.

---

## üìå Features

1. Defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)`:
   - If the discount is **20% or higher**, the discount is applied.
   - If the discount is **less than 20%**, the original price is returned.

2. Uses a **try-except block** to handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric values).

3. Provides clear user feedback:
   - Displays the applied discount percentage and the final price (if applicable).
   - Informs the user if no discount was applied.
